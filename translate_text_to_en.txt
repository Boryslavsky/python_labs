Text is the average element of the communication scheme that can be imagined as a three -element structure: Author (addressee) → Text → Reader (addressee).As a median (intermediate) element of a communicative act, the text reveals its specificity in coding and decoding.With regard to the speaker (addressee), the text is encoded as the speaker encodes some information.To perceive the information contained in the text, the reader must decode it (AP Zagnitko).

The text is generated by the speaker, to those who write, according to his plan, with the need for the best transmission of content.The text is edited at the stage of internal, thinking preparation, and in writing - also in the process of self -editing, in accordance with the stylistic norms of language, communicative feasibility in each individual situation.

In modern linguistics, two approaches in linguistic research of texts have been distinguished:

functional typology (social functions and purpose of using texts) and
Structural typology (internal organization of texts) (MR Lviv).
The first direction significantly reproduces the traditional classification for rhetoric, which brings the types of speech (text) with genres: it is a story, a description, a reflection.Another, structural, approach ("text linguistics") is associated with the detection, study and modeling of intra -textual connections, and the concept of "text component" (paragraph, non -frase unity, complex syntactic whole, etc.) is introduced.
